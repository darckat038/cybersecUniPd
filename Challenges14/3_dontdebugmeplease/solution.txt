In this program, if we analyze it, we will find out that it simply take a string 
as input and directly compare it with the flag. We need to find and print the 
memory location where the string (of the flag) is saved.
Steps with gdb:
1. we put a breakpoint just before or at the compare instruction
2. we need to analyze the registers that may be use by strcmp function
3. we can see that rax contains the string give by us
4. but if we analyze the rdi and rsi registers, BOOM! rsi contains the flag
