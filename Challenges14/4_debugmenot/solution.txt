So here, analyzing the program with ida/gdb we find out that when 
the check for every part is done, there is an if else part. In this 
part the program, based on the result of the checks, put on the test done,
FAIL or PASS. So in assembly there are 3 je instruction consecutively that 
jump respectively if the result are UNKOWN, FAILED or PASS.
We need to modify the first je to jump unconditionally to the PASS section.

Steps:
1. open the file with radare2
2. seek the line of the first je of the if part (0x1238)
3. write on that line the code to jump to the PASS part (jmp 0x12d8)
4. and BOOM! now the program will PASS when executed either normally or with gdb
