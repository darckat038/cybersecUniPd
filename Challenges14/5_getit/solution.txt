So, in this case we used a combination of gdb, radare2 and ida.
From the disassembly, especially from ida we can see 2 fprintf functions,
and 1 fputc function: the first fprint function write all asterisks in the flag.txt
file located in /tmp, and the cicle with fputc in the file and change one by one the 
asterisks with characters, but the second fprintf reset the all asterisks string in the flag 
file at the end of every putc. The solution is to delete this second fprintf with RADARE2, and then 
execute the program with GDB and stop it just before it remove the file.
