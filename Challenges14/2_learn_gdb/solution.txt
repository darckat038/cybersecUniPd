Analyzing this problem we can see that it calls a function named decrypt_flag 
which goal is to generate the flag and put it in a variable named <flag_buf>
but not printing it. 
We need to execute the function and then print the memory address corresponding 
to the variable.

Steps with gdb:
1. with gdb we put a breakpoint just after the call to the decrypt_flag function
 (0x40090a)
2. then, when the function is executed we need to find the variable 
name or its address ("flag_buf" or 0x6022a0)
3. we have to print it, IMPORTANT TO CAST IT IN A CHAR*, otherwise will not 
be readable
4. BOOM! Here is the flag
