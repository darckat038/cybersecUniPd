In this case we can analyze the program with ida64/gdb/radare2. We can then find out that 
the username is: john galt, and the password: more-secure-password. But if we insert them the program 
will end without showing the flag. We need to analyze it better, and will eventually find out that there
is a function called printFlag that is not called but we need to. 
Steps (with gdb):
1. insert a breakpoint for example just before the input given by the user or at the main (b main)
2. find out the address of the printFlag function (0x56555789)
3. run the program
4. when it stops on breakpoint, call a jump to printFlag, with its address or by name
5. BOOM! you have the flag
