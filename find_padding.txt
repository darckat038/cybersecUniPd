1. Open the file with gdb
2. set a breakpoint on the padding instruction (and 0xfffffff0, $rsp (o $esp))
3. look at the content of the $rsp casted in int (which is/are address/es)
4. then go to next instruction (nexti or next)
5. look at the content of the $rsp casted int int
6. look at the difference between the stack pointer before and after
7. that will be the size of the padding in byte
