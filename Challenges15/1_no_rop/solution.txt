So in this case we have two variables: one an int (pass) and one a buffer (buff).
The goal here is to write into the pass variable to going through the if.
We need stack overflow. We have the buff size set to 8 (bytes), but we can 
insert more than 8 chars (bytes). So we insert 9 bytes. This way, it will overflow
the size of buff and will write into below variable in the stack (pass).
Then we execute and BOOM! Here is the flag.
