So in this case we have two variables: one an int (pass) and one a buffer (buff).
The goal here is to write into the pass variable to going through the if.
In the stack, these two variables will be put one next(or below) the other, in this case 
pass will be put as first and buffer as second, next to pass.
We need a stack overflow. We have the buff size set to 8 (bytes), but we can 
insert more than 8 chars (bytes). So we insert 9 bytes. This way, it will overflow
the size of buff and will write into below variable in the stack (pass).
Then we execute and BOOM! Here is the flag.
