So here the program is a little bit more diffucult.
As we can see it asks for an input, and that is stored
in a variable inside a struct, and then, just below that variable 
there is another one that store the pointer to a function to 
be executed at the end. 
The goal here is to fill up the favourite_lang
variable and then overwrite the call variable with the address 
of the execlp function that we can find inside the bash function.
USE A STACK OVERFLOW
