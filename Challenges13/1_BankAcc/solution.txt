Here the problem is a little bit different. You have no way to guess the 
OTP code requested by the program. So you need first to analyze the code 
with IDA or GDB and then OVERWRITE some lines with RADARE2.
Steps:
1. find the line where there is the jump based on the input (0x401e84)
2. OVERWRITE that line with some code that will suit like NOP (1 byte)
2.1 code example ("wa nop;nop" , REMEMBER TO LOOK AT THE SIZE TO WRITE)
3. now if you execute, BOOM! here is the flag
